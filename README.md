# `microtile-engine`

A microscopic Tetris® inspired game engine, targeting embedded devices.
For a running application, see [`microtile-app`](https://github.com/90degs2infty/microtile-app).

I'm enrolled in the 2023 edition of the [Making Embedded Systems course by Elecia White](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/cohort).
This repository is part of my final project submission.
